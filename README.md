
This is simple 3D Engine, wich I am making while studing computer graphics. 

For now it contains logging system (based on spdlog), very simple 2D rendering system (based on openGL) and also a very simple editor interface (based on imGui) also glm library is being used here for matrix and vector calculations 

TODO:
add coordinate system
