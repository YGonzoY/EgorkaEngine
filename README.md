
This is simple 3D Engine, wich I am making while studing computer graphics. 


Libraries used:
OpenGl
ImGui
GLM
SpdLog

Ortographical and perspective cameras are available, 3D space, rendering and object manipulating 

In the future abilities to import textures and 3D models will be avalible.
